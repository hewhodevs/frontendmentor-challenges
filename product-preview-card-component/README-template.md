## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

1. Focused on semantic elements
2. How to make a sticky footer using flexbox
3. How to darken a button background color on hover


1. The MDN docs recommend using the article element for a product card. I opted to use h1 as the title here, since we cant assume how nested this product card may be on a site, but typically I'd say a h2 heading is appropriate here. I also grouped the perfume "category" in the heading as it is relevant for it. A bold tag was used for the price to draw attention, rather than using a strong tag which would incorrectly imply that the price is more important than the product name or description. Alt text was used on images, and the aria-hidden=true attribute applied to the button icon as it provides no extra meaning for screen readers.

2. Making a sticky footer was done by the use of flexbox to allow for variable height content designs. This was inspired by the following article by Chris Coyier [Sticky Footer, Five Ways](https://css-tricks.com/couple-takes-sticky-footer/#aa-there-is-flexbox)

3. I initially tried filter:brightness(0.85) when hovering the add to cart button, but this also brightened the text which is not desired. I opted instead to wrap the button in a div, give the wrapper div the green backgroud, make the button background transparent, then alter the button background alpha value on hover. You can see a demo of this at the following codepen I made [CSS darken or lighten button background color on hover](https://codepen.io/hewhodevs/pen/oNqJmVr)

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
